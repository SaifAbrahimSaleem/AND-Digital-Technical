<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A well-known British shoe company, Golden Shoe, has seen a steady decline in revenue over the couple of years, and the newly appointed CEO and leadership team are ready to
confront digital disruption heads on. Golden Shoe make most of their revenue from their stores, but they do have an online presence too.

They have a flagship store in London, however it is located next to their main competitor, which seems to be much busier than the Golden Shoe store. Their e-Commerce platform
was built around 9 years ago, when most online interaction was done using a desktop. Conversion rate has declined rapidly, and the dropout rates in mobile and ipad devices have
increased dramatically. Global Shoe have no mobile app. They have quarterly releases, which works well, though it is impossible to get any small changes in quicker than this.
They are aware of the benefits of Agile but are concerned about how to upskill their current loyal workforce, and convince the leadership team.
